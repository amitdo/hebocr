hebOCR is a free Hebrew OCR (optical character recognition) library based on the
hebocr c/c++ library originally written by Dr. by Kobi Zamir. The aim of this
project is to develop a fully open-source and free OCR (or hebrew definition)


Official downloads are available at http://code.google.com/p/hebocr/downloads/list
Full code is available using mercrial:

hg clone https://hebocr.googlecode.com/hg/ hebocr

If you want to submit code, contact me via my email and I will give you
permissions to the repository.

This library is a fork of libhocr. The fork was done since the library was
not really maintained, and the rename was done due to Google's HOCR tools
project. See:
